I want to use createResource and the Fetch API to consume the backend, using the Context API to share the data across the component hierarchy.
I want to display the data (song title, album, artist, genre, and release date) from the API within a table on the frontend.  
I want to be able to filter the table of music by album, artist, genre, and title.  
TODO: I want to be able to add a song to my database by using Axios to make a POST request to the backend
TODO: I want to be able to delete a song from my table, initiating a DELETE request to my backend
TODO: I want to be able to update the song data in my table using a modal popup window that initiates a PUT request to the backend
TODO: I want to have an aesthetically pleasing user interface to ensure a great user experience. (styling, animations/transitions)
